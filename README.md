# QGIS Full Motion Video (FMV) #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/All4Gis/QGISFMV.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/All4Gis/QGISFMV)

![a](images/banner.png)

Plugin for QGIS > 2.99 which allows to analyze, visualize and process videos inside the QGIS environment. QGIS FMV accepts multiple video formats such as mp4, ts, avi, etc. It is also able to extract video frames, to capture the current frame, to plot bitrate and to observe the video metadata with aerial images and more. It also offers the possibility to create reports with video metadata.

Standards supported:

  - "UAS Datalink Local Set", [ST0601.11](http://www.gwg.nga.mil/misb/docs/standards/ST0601.11.pdf)

  
## Motivation

This development arises after observing that there was no free solution for the metadata extraction and video analysis in real time. All solutions are APIs or private tools such as
[Esri](http://www.esri.com/products/arcgis-capabilities/imagery/full-motion-video),
for this reason, I decided to develop this open source project and, this way, offer this open source alternative to the QGIS community.


## Dependencies

* [FFMPEG](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) : After downloading it, you should store it in an accessible folder and modify `fmvConfig.py` with the corresponding path.

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) : `python3 -m pip install opencv-python`

* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) : `python3 -m pip install matplotlib`

* [Klvdata](https://github.com/paretech/klvdata) : customized version of this library.

The plugin install automatically this requisites,but you can install it using:

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


## For show video

To see the video you need:

  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install gst123` (install GStreamer dependencies)
  - Window: install LAV Filters (install <a href="https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases" target="_blank">DirectShow Media Decoders</a>) 


## Usage

The use of this application is simple. It only needs a video with metadata, like for example one of these [videos](http://samples.ffmpeg.org/MPEG2/mpegts-klv/) or [these (ESRI copyright)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-B2uaW7_cfYZohZYFozrgBhIaztI1MSP)
Then, open the plugin where the "video manager" will be shown, open the video and with a double-click, the "player" will be opened. 
At this moment, you will see that new shapes have been added and you will see the platform position, metadata, etc.
